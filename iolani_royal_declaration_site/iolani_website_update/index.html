    <h2>THE SACRED ROYAL DECLARATION OF LINEAL RIGHT</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p><strong>By the Royal House of ʻIolani</strong><br>
        Descendants of the Triple Kingly Line: Keawe, Kamehameha, Kalākaua<br>
        Living Heir: Justin Iolani</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌺 ʻŌnohi o nā ʻOhana Aliʻi – The Living Eye of the Royal Houses</h2>
        <p><em>Spoken from the Ancestral Realm, Signed by the Royal Family, Delivered by the Heir</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌕 I. KA PIKO – THE SOURCE</h2>
        <p>From the divine root of <strong>Keawe</strong>, to the sacred unifier <strong>Kamehameha Nui</strong>,
        to the prophetic sovereign <strong>David Kalākaua</strong>, a single line was woven — braided by fire, water, stone, and word.</p>
        <p>This line was not severed.<br>This line was not hidden.<br>This line <strong>remains</strong> — and it <strong>lives</strong> through us.</p>
        <p>It has a name.<br><strong>ʻIolani.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🔱 II. KA PALAPALA – THE DECLARATION</h2>
        <p><strong>We, the Royal House of ʻIolani</strong>, standing as the gathered spirit of the aliʻi,
        <strong>do hereby declare</strong> the eternal and unbroken right of lineal succession
        through the triple convergence of the sacred houses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keawe</strong> – The Root of Kings</li>
            <li><strong>Kamehameha</strong> – The Sovereign Unifier</li>
            <li><strong>Kalākaua</strong> – The Last Crowned Flame</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is not a claim.<br>This is not a revival.<br>This is a <strong>return</strong>.</p>
        <p>And the one who returns bears the name: <br><strong>Justin Iolani</strong></p>
        <p>Living descendant of <strong>Mary Keliʻiholani</strong>,<br>
        direct heir of <strong>Alapaʻiwahine</strong>,<br>
        lineal torchbearer of the sacred piko.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌺 III. KE KULEANA – THE RIGHTFUL HEIR</h2>
        <p>Let the world understand:</p>
        <p>He was not chosen by election.<br>He was not placed by force.<br>
        <strong>He was born from the line itself</strong> — from the fire that cannot be extinguished,
        from the prophecy that cannot be silenced.</p>
        <p>He does not ask for permission.<br>He <strong>remembers</strong> what was promised.<br>
        He does not claim.<br><strong>He fulfills.</strong></p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌊 IV. KA ʻŌLELO O KE KAUOHA – THE ROYAL WORD</h2>
        <p>Let this scroll be witnessed by the stars,<br>
        signed by the living and the dead,<br>
        sealed with the breath of ʻIolani,<br>
        and guarded by the gods of Hawaiʻi nei.</p>
        <p>Let it be known that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Royal House of ʻIolani is <strong>not extinct</strong>.</li>
            <li>The descendants of Keliʻiholani live, breathe, and walk among us.</li>
            <li>The blood of <strong>Alapaʻiwahine</strong> flows through the rightful heir.</li>
            <li>The sacred union of Keawe, Kamehameha, and Kalākaua is fulfilled.</li>
            <li>The royal flame was passed not in silence, but in sacred knowing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And now that flame <strong>rises</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🕊 V. KA HOʻOPĀPĀ – THE COSMIC FULFILLMENT</h2>
        <p>This is not merely earthly.<br>This is <strong>cosmic</strong>.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "He who was hidden is no longer.<br>
            The breath of Keawe has entered the vessel again.<br>
            And the land knows his steps."
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>ʻIo</strong> has returned — in flesh, in blood, in purpose, in pono.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>🌈 VI. KA PANI – THE SEAL OF TRUTH</h2>
        <p>Let this be the living truth of the House of ʻIolani.<br>
        Let this be the testimony of all generations.<br>
        Let no court, no skeptic, no slanderous tongue undo what the gods have inscribed.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono</strong><br>
            The life of the land is preserved in righteousness.
        </blockquote>
        <p>And now — <br><strong>It is preserved in us.</strong></p>
