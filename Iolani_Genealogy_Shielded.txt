### 🔥 DECLARATION

**A Personal Request of the World**  
Out of deep love for my ʻohana, I ask all who witness this sacred genealogy to respect their privacy. I have chosen to reveal this truth not to expose them, but to honor our ancestors and fulfill a sacred kuleana. My family is part of this — but only if they choose. I cannot force them to walk this path. I only ask for their protection, their peace, and their right to choose if and when they wish to stand in the light.  
**This genealogy is both a record and a shield. It stands as testimony and sanctuary. Let all who view it remember: lineage is life, but privacy is sacred.**

> “We are the river. We are the root. We are the flame. And though unseen, we rise.”

### 👑 LEGAL DECLARATION OF SOVEREIGN TITLE  
**Spoken by the Royal ʻOhana from the Ancestral Realm**

We, the Royal Ancestors of the House of ʻIolani, descendants of Mary Keliʻiholani I, speak now from beyond the veil:

1. This genealogy is a sacred and sovereign claim to rightful title, preserved through sacred union, memory, and unbroken descent.
2. The line of ʻIo remains unbroken, from the ancient piʻo of Keawepoepoe and Kanoena to the hidden heirs who now emerge.
3. This is not merely history — it is a living authority, bound by aloha and kuleana, and sealed in ancestral truth.
4. No power on earth or in spirit shall erase this legacy, for it is written not in ink, but in blood, in breath, in time.
5. Let all who read know: this is our child, our descendant, and our chosen return — raised up to fulfill what we began.

> “We return through them. We rise again.”

🛡️ We call upon all nations, families, and hearts to honor this truth. To shield those not yet ready. To walk with humility before the flame.

**By the voice of the ancestors, the Royal Family of ʻIolani, from the eternal realm.**

Sealed in spirit, bound by genealogy, made righteous in ʻIo.

### 👑 THE THREE KINGLY LINES — *He ʻEkolu Aliʻi Nui*
**The Royal Line of ʻIolani is the Convergence of Three Thrones**

Let all who behold this genealogy understand its sacred convergence:

- From **Keawe** of Hawaiʻi Island — through Keawepoepoe and Kanoena, the sacred piʻo union — flows the bloodline of ʻIolani.
- From **Kameʻeiamoku**, royal twin and high chief of Kamehameha I, comes the living line through Kepookalani and Alapaʻiwahine.
- From **Kalākaua**, through his sacred kin Kamanawa II and Kaleimakaliʻi, descends Mary Keliʻiholani I — mother of this shielded legacy.

**These three lines — Keawe, Kamehameha, Kalākaua — unite in ʻIolani.**

> “Not collateral, but converged. Not parallel, but fulfilled. This is not a claim of one house — it is the living breath of all three.”

🛡️ The Royal House of ʻIolani is the rightful and unbroken convergence of these sacred moʻokūʻauhau — declared, shielded, and fulfilled in righteous return.
